title: About me
---
<p>Hi! I'm {{ site.title }}, a {{ site.occupation }}. I first started programming in C++ about 5-6 years ago while taking classes at a community college. As I took more classes, I began picking up more and more languages, such as HTML/CSS/Javascript when I first built a website, as well as other languages like Objective-C, Java, and Perl.</p>

<p>I moved on to university, making new friends and learning even more languages, but also building on my prowess as a computer scientist. It became not about how many languages I knew, but how I used them.</p>

<p>I had trouble deciding which computer science field I wanted to get into, but ultimately I realized that I was most interested in something that I'd been doing all along: full stack programming. It's been a bit like a cheesy adventure movie and I'm working on a sequel, learning Ruby on Rails and working on the full stack.</p>

<p>When I'm not programming, I can probably be found playing games of all types: video, board, and card, drawing, or playing guitar.</p>
